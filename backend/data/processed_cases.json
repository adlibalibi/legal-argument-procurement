The High Court was of the opinion that: “It is well settled principle of law that preparation of any offence cannot be termed as attempt to commit the same offence, I am of the considered view that the strength of evidence on record the offence of indecent assault is made out beyond reasonable doubt .

      "Facts": "No ECs were sought before the commencement or expansion of operations, as mandated by the 1994 EIA notification . They continued to operate in the teeth of the said notification . NGT’s directions for revocation of the ECs and closure of the units do not accord with the principle of proportionality – Industries to deposit compensation of ` 10 crores each, in addition to the amount directed by NGT – Environment (Protection) Rules 1986 – Constitution of India – Art.142 .",
      "Issues": "The NGT did not have the jurisdiction to strike down the circular dated 14 May 2002, it was urged that the circular was issued by the MoEF pursuant to its powers under Section 3 of the Environment Protection Act 1986 . The issue to be adjudicated is whether in view of the requirement of a prior EC under the EIA notification of 1994, a provision for an ex post facto EC to industrial units could be validly made by means of the circular .",
      "Reasoning": "1994 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) notification mandated prior Environmental Clearance (EC) for setting up and expansion of industrial units falling within thirty categories . Deadline extended by various circulars – 2002 Circular while further extending the deadline allowed for ex post facto ECs – Quashed by National Green Tribunal (NGT) On appeal, held: Concept of an ex-post facto EC is in derogation of the fundamental principles of environmental jurisprudence – It is an anathema to the 1994 EIA notification .",
      "Decision": "The High Court has ordered closure of the entire plant as directed by the High Court . However, since the expansion has been undertaken and the industry has been functioning, we do not deem it appropriate to order closure . The plant has been undergoing an expansion and industry is functioning, the court said ."

As per the will, the ground floor portion was bequeathed to the respondent- plaintiff, the first floor portion to the appellant-defendant and the second floor to be divided equally between them – Respondent filed suit for partition of second floor and terrace rights . The High Court found that normally a driveway on ground floor of the property would be a common area . But in the peculiar facts of the instant case, the suit property also has a side lane from which there is a direct entrance to the staircase .",
      "Issues": "High Court set aside the trial court judgment to the extent of directions for sale of second floor and terrace rights and issued certain directions in respect of common areas including ground floor .

      "Facts": "The phrase ‘sale in the course of import’ carries three essential features - (i) that there must be a sale; (ii) that goods must actually be imported into the territory of India; and (iii) that the sale must be part and parcel of the import – sale would become part of import if it either occasions such import or if it occurs by way of a transfer of document of title to the goods before the goods have crossed the customs frontiers of India . High Court was right in observing that once the appellant got the goods released by filing bill of entry for home consumption, the import stream mixed in the movement of the goods .",
      "Issues": "Customs Act, 1962: s.2(26) – Importer, who is – Sale on High Seas – Appellant’s case was that there was a quadripartite agreement whereby the supplier sold the goods in question to the first-buyer and delivered them at the port of shipment . Thereafter, while the goods were on high seas, first buyer transferred them to the appellant by endorsing the bill of lading in favour of the appellant . High Court held that this definition of importer cannot be used to usurp the identity of an importer from the person who filed bill of entry .",
      "Reasoning": "The High Court rejected the suggestion of second high seas sales in favour of the end-buyers and held that the only attempt of the appellant had been to avoid inter-State sales under the CST Act . High Court also rejected the contention that the entire import was occasioned by ultimate sale in . favour of Radha and, therefore, the matter would also be covered .",
      "Decision": "Devika Gujral appeals dismissed with costs and with the observations foregoing . Devika Gujral appeals against the respondent shall be entitled to adjust the same against the dues of the appellant .

      "Issues": "A tripartite agreement was arrived at, under which a person whose lands were acquired would be entitled to employment by a company if the acquired land-holding was at least 2 acres – Respondent claimed employment .
